Explaining Datasets %in% /'Data'

friends.csv = first pull of elites' 'friends' profile information (Took 3 hours to 
compile. These data include strings of locations from each user object as well as user 
ID and which elite they are associated with. This file also has information on 
date_created of account, number followers, and number friends, for possible analysis 
of fake accounts.

friends_cleaned.csv = stripped accents from entries with "Unidecode"

full_locations.csv = all longitude and latitudes for all locations in dataset. These 
are associated with the corresponding elite. These data do not have information about 
the names of the locations.

latin_characters.csv = dictionary of utf-8 characters to help with cleaning. This file 
is just for reference.

locs_dict.csv = Short for: locations_dictionary. This is the key:value,value 
information that was accessed through geocode API and connected with each unique 
'string' for location. This file is MOST USEFUL because data vizualization can be done 
without having to make calls to the Google Maps API which deeply hates me for making 7 
new gmail accounts and a ton of codes. 
*Credit to github user: abhishekaanjana for forgetting to protect their API key on a 
public respository from a couple years ago, which I 'borrowed' to finish this 
assignment due to 24 hour waiting periods for my 7 other keys.
